      "My invention relates to improvements in\n",
      "orchard trailer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principal purpose of the invention is to\n",
      "provide an improved trailer construction for use\n",
      "in orchards and similar areas of such a nature\n",
      "that the loading platform of the trailer can be\n",
      "placed quite low, yet the supporting wheels of\n",
      "the trailer consisting of pairs of wheels in tan-\n",
      "dem can be given unlimited movement circum-\n",
      "ferentially of the frame supporting axle so that\n",
      "the trailer can be operated in exceptionally rough\n",
      "ground without difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "My invention is illustrated in connection with\n",
      "a trailer frame which is adapted to be hitched to\n",
      "a tractor and pulled about the orchard for load-\n",
      "ing fruit boxes and removing them from the\n",
      "orchard. In many orchards very difficult ground\n",
      "conditions are encountered due to ditches or\n",
      "other uneven ground levels. It is important in\n",
      "the loading of the trailer to have the loading\n",
      "platform at all times supported fairly close to\n",
      "the ground. It is also important to have the\n",
      "frame supported by wheels in such a manner\n",
      "that it is possible to get good support at a plural-\n",
      "ity of spaced points lengthwise of the frame. It\n",
      "sometimes occurs that one wheel of a tandem\n",
      "pair will rest on a hummock or a high ridge\n",
      "while the other wheel of the pair is in a low\n",
      "spot. The line-connecting the supports of the\n",
      "two: wheels may be at-an angle of more than\n",
      "30 degrees to the horizontal. According to my\n",
      "invention I provide wheeled supports to the truck\n",
      "frame which can be rotated with respect to the\n",
      "truck frame thus giving unlimited movement of\n",
