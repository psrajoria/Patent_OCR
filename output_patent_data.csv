: 2 Claims.

My invention relates to improvements in
orchard trailer.

The principal purpose of the invention is to
provide an improved trailer construction for use
in orchards and similar areas of such a nature
that the loading platform of the trailer can be
placed quite low, yet the supporting wheels of
the trailer consisting of pairs of wheels in tan-
dem can be given unlimited movement circum-
ferentially of the frame supporting axle so that
the trailer can be operated in exceptionally rough
ground without difficulty.

My invention is illustrated in connection with
a trailer frame which is adapted to be hitched to
a tractor and pulled about the orchard for load-
ing fruit boxes and removing them from the
orchard. In many orchards very difficult ground
conditions are encountered due to ditches or
other uneven ground levels. It is important in
the loading of the trailer to have the loading
platform at all times supported fairly close to
the ground. It is also important to have the
frame supported by wheels in such a manner
that it is possible to get good support at a plural-
ity of spaced points lengthwise of the frame. It
sometimes occurs that one wheel of a tandem
pair will rest on a hummock or a high ridge
while the other wheel of the pair is in a low
spot. The line-connecting the supports of the
two: wheels may be at-an angle of more than
30 degrees to the horizontal. According to my
invention I provide wheeled supports to the truck
frame which can be rotated with respect to the
truck frame thus giving unlimited movement of
the wheels in a vertical plane so that they may
adapt themselves to any rough ground conditions
encountered.

The novel features of my invention are set
forth with particularity in the appended claims.
The invention itself, however, both as to its or-
ganization and its operation, together with ad-
ditional objects and advantages thereof, will best
be understood from the following description of
@ specific embodiment when read in connection
with the accompanying drawings in which:

Figure 1 is a plan view of an orchard trailer
embodying my invention;

trailer;

Figure 3 is a fragmentary plan view of the
connections between the trailer frame and the
supporting wheels;

tion of the trailer frame showing the mounting
of the axle thereon;

Figure 10 is a detail.view illustrating the con-

‘Referring now to the drawings and particu-
larly to Figure 1 there is shown an orchard
trailer, the main body of which comprises a rec-
tangular framework {0 composed of steel chan-
nels. These channels are welded together at the
corners and are braced by providing corner gus-
sets 11. The frame is reinforced by transversely
extending steel channels {2.and 18. The channel
{2 together with one of the end channels serves
to secure a draw bar 14 by mounting depending
plates 15 and 16 to which the draw bar 14 is
welded: The draw bar 14 extending. forwardly
from the front end of the trailer frame may be
provided with any suitable attaching means for
attaching it to a tractor. The trailer frame 10
is adapted to be covered by any suitable flooring
such as plank.so that fruit: boxes and the like
can be:stacked thereon in the usual manner. ,

The support for the trailer comprises an axle
{7 at each side of the frame. These axles !7 are
mounted to the frame by bearing blocks {8 welded

5S to the underside of the frame and bearing caps

{9 which are bolted to the blocks 18 by suitable
bolts 20. The axles are connected by a tube 21
into which they extend a substantial distance.
The axles are rotatable in the bearing on the
frame and in the tube 21 so that either axle may
turn independently of the other. As shown in
Figure 9, the axles 17 extend into the tube 2!
and are held against endwise movement by any
conventional means such as a groove [Ta in the
axle and a pin 2ia set in the tube 21.

A rocker arm 22 is provided for each of the
axles [1. The two rocker arms are alike so that
a description of one will suffice for both. Each
rocker arm has an axle sleeve 23 welded to its
flange and the axle sleeve is further braced by
welding two braces 24 and 25 to the under sur-
faces of the sleeve and to the rocker arm at a
distance from the sleeve. The rocker arm is also
made of a steel channel of the same size as the
trailer frame. The sleeve 23 is secured on the
2,488,002

axle by providing a lock ring 26 at the outer end
of the axle 17 and fixing the lock ring in position
by a cotter pin 27.

Fach rocker arm carries two spindle blocks 28
and 29 at its opposite ends. These blocks are
made up of separate channel shaped sections 38
and 3f which have their edge faces welded as
indicated ‘at 32 (see Figure 6). A wheel-spindle.
33 is welded to the spindle block and has a cylin-
drical section 34 to which the wheel axle is at-
tached. The wheel mounting is conventional.
Figure 10 illustrates how the wheel.axle.43 is
clamped to the spindle 33.

The construction just described provides two
wheels 35 and 36 in tandem on:each.rocker arm.
The rocker arms are free to. rotate throughout
a complete revolution about. the axle 17.. Thus
the wheels can shift from the full line position
shown in Figure 2 to such a position as the dotted
line position shown in Figure 2.

The construction: provides an. additional fea-
ture in. that the trailer frame can be carried at
two different levels by the same tandem wheels.
If for example, the-rocker arm is ratated -180
degrees about the axle I7 it will be beneath the
axle -17 instead of over it; as ‘shown in Figure 2.
The net result will be to raise the frame. an
amount equal .to the distance from: the axle to
the top of the rocker arm 22. This feature of
the invention.may also. be realized on sloping
ground to raise one side. of the trailer frame to
a higher level-than the other.

The principal feature of the-invention how-
ever, lies in the -fact that ‘the rocker arms are
so mounted as to enable ‘the wheels to adjust
themselves ta-great variations in ground level at
any time, thus one -pair of tandem. wheels may
have the front wheel on’ a:hummock and the
rear wheel in the. ditch while exactly the opposite
condition exists with respect. to the other pair.
of ‘tandem: wheels. In all. conditions the direc-
tion of pull.on the frame will be at an advanta-
geous angle with resnect to:the. surfaces on which
the pair of wheels:rests.-

In Figures :7 and8 there is shown. 2 modified
form .of the invention wherein the trailer frame
{0"". has:-a. supporting channel 31 welded: to its
lower flange... A heavy bushing 38 is flattened
at. the top-and welded to the lower flange of the
channel: 37.

The axle #1’ extends. through this

an aperture 40 in the rocker arm 22’ and welded
in place. A support brace 41 is L-shaped in
cross section. The short leg of the brace is
welded to the frame 10’ and the long leg of the
brace extends down to the axle at the outer end
of the sleeve 39. The brace is bifurcated at its
lower end to fit over the axle {T’. A tie plate
42 is: welded to: the brace and the frame to give
the brace additional strength. This modified
form uses the same lock ring 26’ for securing
the axle as the main form of the invention. The
axles 17’ are extended into the tube 2{ in the
same manner -as in the main form of the in-
vention. The rocker arm however cannot rotate
in this form. ofthe invention since the brace
&tis:in the way.

Having thus described my invention, I claim:

I. A trailer for use in orchards and the like
comprising a framework having oppositely dis-
posed steel channels forming side frame mem-
bers,. an..axle bearing. welded. to the.under..side
of each frame member, an axle rotatahle in each.
bearing, tubular means receiving the inner ends
of said axles. and connecting them together,. a
steel channel rocker arm positioned against. the..
outside of each of said bearings and side. frame.
member and having an axle sleeve welded thereto.
and abutting the bearing, and wheels mounting.
the opposite ends of said rocker arms.

2.-A trailer and wheel mounting therefor com-~
prising steel channel side frames and cross frame.
members, an axle bearing secured on each. side
frame,. two wheel supported roecker..arms, each’
having two supporting wheels. rotatably mounted.
thereon. at the ends. thereof, axles centrally.
mounted on.each arm.and extending into. said.
bearings, and a tube extending across the space.
hetween the side frames and receiving the ends
of said axles inwardly of the side frames.
