CORLISS\\nEVONYMUS FORTUNEI PLANT\\n\\nFiled Dec. 19, 1947\\n\\nPlant Pat. 881\\n\\na\\n\\nPatented Oct. 18, 1949\\n\\nPlant Pat. 881\\n\\nUNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE\\n\\n881\\nEUONYMUS FORTUNEI PLANT\\n\\nClifford D. Corliss, Magnolia, Mass., assignor to\\nCorliss Bros. Ine., Gloucester, Mass., a corpora-\\ntion of Massachusetts\\n\\nApplication December 19, 1947, Serial No. 792,707\\n\\n1 Claim.\\n\\n1\\n\\nThis invention relates to a new and distinct\\nvariety of Euonymus fortunei plant, an evergreen\\noriginated by me from a selected seedling pro-\\nduced by crossing Euonymus fortunei vegeta and\\nHuonymus fortunei radicans.\\n\\nThis new variety possesses a number of desir-\\nable characteristics clearly distinguishing it from\\nits parents and other similar evergreen varieties,\\nand the following comparisons will suffice to\\npoint out its particular advantages of utility for\\nornamental purposes.\\n\\nIt is well known that Euonymus fortunei varie-\\nties of vegeta and radicans embody irregular and\\nprostrate plants of viney growth that grow up-\\nright only if supported. The habit of my new\\nshrub is distinctly upright without support, the\\nwhole plant growing and branching compactly\\nfrom one central stem, and the branches and\\nbranchlets being almost perfectly uniform, The\\nordinary vegeta, type can be trained to shrub\\nform only by constant shearing, whereas my new\\nvariety requires no shearing, and in fact it has\\n\\n“never been sheared, It is well known that neither\\n\\nthe radicans variety nor the vegeta variety can\\nbe grown or trained for hedging unless sheared\\nand supported. The variety of the present in-\\nvention can be used as an excellent hedge plant\\nbecause of its upright growth entirely unsup-\\nported. It is definitely not a vine in any way,\\nshape or manner.\\n\\nThe plant of this new variety is an evergreen\\nshrub possessing great decorative value in its dis-\\ntinctive bushy erect habit of growth, in its sturdy\\ncharacter and appearance, its beautiful clusters\\nof berries in the fall, and its formation of a neat,\\ncompact, uniform shrub with an average height\\nof 4-5 feet, and spread of about 2% feet. Like\\nvegeta, this shrub of mine bears, very heavily,\\nclusters of the bittersweet type berries. These\\nberries, seven to ten in a cluster, when ripened\\nto expose their bright orange coloring enhance\\nthe beauty of the shrub.\\n\\nThe growth of the plant is likewise unique and\\nadvantageous for use aS a Specimen shrub plant\\nwhere formal effects are desired.. This is due\\nto the fact of the uniformity and compactness\\nwith which the plant grows from one central\\nstem with erectness of the lateral branches and\\nbranchlets affording the comparative uniformity\\nof shape, previously mentioned.\\n\\nMy Euonymus plant presents the appearance\\nof.a deeper green colored foliage as distinguished\\nfrom the appearance of the dark green coloring\\nof the vegeta variety which it resembles in leaf\\ncharacter because of its thicker leaves. The\\n\\n(CL 4%7—59)\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n35\\n\\n40\\n\\n45\\n\\n50\\n\\n55\\n\\n2\\n\\nleaves of my evergreen Euonymus are somewhat\\nbroader and more ovate than vegeta, as well as\\nhaving a glossy appearance as distinguished from\\nthe dull leaf of vegeta.\\n\\nIn addition to the foregoing advantages, my\\nevergreen Euonymus apparently is. not suscep-\\ntible to scale, or other diseases, since nothing has\\naffected or attacked it up to the present time.\\nAnother very important feature is its hardiness,\\nhaving withstood as low as 20 degrees below zero\\nwith no ill effects, on the North Shore of Massa-\\nchusetis, and no sign of any winter burn which\\nis more or less prevalent in the vegeta type. My\\nplant stands extremely dry conditions well.\\n\\n‘The strong fibrous root system of my new ever-\\ngreen Huonymus permits easy and successful\\ntransplanting of the shrub with a good ball of\\nearth, These plants do well in average garden\\nsoil which greatly widens the scope of their use.\\n\\nAsexual reproductions by cuttings of this new\\nvariety were made at Ipswich, Mass., and they\\nshow the foregoing characteristics come true to\\nform and are established. .\\n\\nThe accompanying drawing illustrates a speci-\\n\\n5 men of this new variety, depicting its habit of\\n\\nerect uniformly branched growth.\\n\\nThe following is a detailed description of the\\nnew variety, color terminology being in accord-\\nance with ordinary dictionary significance:\\n\\nClassification: Euonymus fortunei var. (vegeta\\nx radicans).\\n\\n‘Habit: Distinctly upright without support; plant\\n\\narises from a central stem; form of shrub\\novoid, well bushed at the base. The regular\\nvegeta which it resembles in leaf character is\\na@ more or less prostrate vine which grows\\nupright only if supported.\\n\\nLeaves and branchlets: Leaves evergreen, 3-5\\ncm. long, opposite, petioled, broad ovate to sub-\\norbicular; margin crenate-serrate; apex emar-\\nginate; dark glossy green above; light dull\\ngreen beneath; veins slightly more prominent\\non the upper than on the under surface; tex-\\nture somewhat thicker than on regular vege-\\ntus. Branchlets—medium green, minutely\\nwarty, tending to form aerial rootlets on the\\nolder branches.
